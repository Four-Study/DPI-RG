### Distribution-Free Predictive Inference Using Generative Roundtrip Models

This repository contains the files for the project listed on arXiv. You can access it [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10732).

I would like to acknowledge the inferential Wasserstein GAN work, as I borrowed some code from their project. You can find more details [here](https://academic.oup.com/jrsssb/article/84/1/83/7056079).
